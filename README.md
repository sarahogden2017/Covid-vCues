# COVID vCues Dataset

This is a dataset research project developed to assist Professor Ankur Chattopadhyay's COVID vCues research by creating a multi-modal dataset containing images sourced from reliable and unreliable sources on COVID-19. This dataset will be used to train multiple AI models: reliable vs unreliable images, identify memes, identify ads, and more TBD.

## To-Do
- [X] Scrape CoAID (Sarah)
- [X] Scrape ReCovery (Shreetika)      **Needs citation
- [ ] Scrape MM-Covid (Shreetika)
- [ ] Consolidate CoAID, ReCovery, & MM-Covid (Sarah)
- [ ] Remove duplicate images
- [ ] Deep learning reliable vs unreliable model
- [ ] Decide on categories to train
- [ ] Develop category identifying models:  
      - [ ] Memes  
      - [ ] Ads  
      - [ ] TBD  
- [ ] Analysis of dataset breakdown

## Sources

The dataset based on **CoAID: COVID-19 Healthcare Misinformation Dataset**, ReCovery, and MM-Covid.
