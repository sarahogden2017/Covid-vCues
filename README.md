# COVID vCues Dataset

This is a dataset research project developed by Sarah Ogden to assist Professor Ankur Chattopadhyay's COVID vCues research by creating a multi-modal dataset containing images sourced from reliable and unreliable sources on COVID-19.

## Sources

The dataset is primarily based on the **CoAID: COVID-19 Healthcare Misinformation Dataset**, developed by Limeng Cui and Dongwon Lee in 2020. The CoAID dataset provides a valuable resource for studying misinformation related to COVID-19, containing a wide range of information from various sources.
